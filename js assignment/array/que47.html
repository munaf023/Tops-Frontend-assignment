    <!-- What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?  -->

    <h3> 1. Increased Memory Usage: Each object instance holds its own copy of methods, consuming more memory compared
        to
        shared methods in prototypes.
        2. Limited Inheritance Support: Objects with inline methods make inheritance less straightforward, hindering the
        ability to extend functionality across object hierarchies.
        3. Reduced Readability and Maintenance: Inline methods can make code harder to understand and maintain,
        especially
        as the number of methods grows or when logic becomes complex.
        4. Challenging Testing: Testing becomes more difficult as inline methods are harder to mock or replace during
        testing scenarios compared to methods defined on prototypes or in separate modules.
