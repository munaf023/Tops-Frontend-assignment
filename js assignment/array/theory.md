1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It was originally developed by Netscape and first released in 1995. JavaScript is a core technology of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS, allowing for client-side scripting of web pages.

2. What is the use of isNaN function?
The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. It returns true if the value is NaN, and false if the value is a valid number or can be converted to one.

3. What is negative Infinity?
Negative Infinity (-Infinity) is a special value in JavaScript that represents the mathematical concept of negative infinity. It is returned when a number exceeds the lower limit of the floating-point numbers JavaScript can handle (approximately -1.7976931348623157e+308).

4. Which company developed JavaScript?
JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, with Brendan Eich creating the first version in just 10 days in May 1995.

5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?
Undeclared variables: These are variables that have been used in code without being declared (using var, let, or const). Accessing an undeclared variable typically results in a ReferenceError.

Undefined variables: These are variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value. In JavaScript, variables that are declared but not initialized are assigned the value undefined by default.

6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
javascript

let newElement = document.createElement('div');

newElement.textContent = 'This is a new element';

let container = document.getElementById('container');
container.appendChild(newElement);

7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
ViewState: ViewState is specific to ASP.NET web applications. It is used to store the state of the page and its controls between postbacks. It is usually stored in a hidden field on the page.

SessionState: SessionState is also specific to ASP.NET (and more broadly, web applications in general). It stores session-specific data on the server and associates it with a user session. It persists data across multiple requests from the same user.

8. What is === operator?
The === operator in JavaScript is the strict equality operator. It compares two values for equality without performing type conversion. It returns true if the operands are strictly equal (same value and same type), otherwise it returns false.

9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?
To change the style of an element in JavaScript:
// Get the element by its ID
let element = document.getElementById('myElementId');

element.style.color = 'red';
element.style.fontSize = '20px';

element.className = 'newClass';

element.classList.add('newClass');
element.classList.remove('oldClass');

10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
In a typical web environment, JavaScript running in a browser does not have direct access to the file system for security reasons. However, in Node.js (server-side JavaScript), you can read and write files using built-in file system modules like fs.

11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

for loop
while loop
do-while loop
for...in loop (for iterating over object properties)
for...of loop (for iterating over iterable objects like arrays)

12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
You can use the parseInt() function in JavaScript to convert a string representing a number in any base (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) to an integer:
let binaryString = '1010';
let decimalNumber = parseInt(binaryString, 2); 
console.log(decimalNumber);

13. What is the function of the delete operator?
The delete operator in JavaScript is used to delete a property from an object, or an element from an array. It does not affect variables declared with var, let, or const.

14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
JavaScript provides three types of popup boxes:

alert(): Displays an alert dialog with a message and an OK button.
confirm(): Displays a dialog with a message and OK/Cancel buttons.
prompt(): Displays a dialog with a message, an input field for the user, and OK/Cancel buttons.

15. What is the use of Void (0)?
The void operator in JavaScript evaluates an expression and then returns undefined. It is often used in conjunction with href attributes in HTML <a> tags to prevent the browser from navigating to a new page when the link is clicked:

<a href="javascript:void(0)">Click me</a>

16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
You can force a page to load another page by setting window.location.href to the URL of the page you want to load:

window.location.href = 'https://www.example.com';

17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
Using innerHTML to manipulate HTML content can have security implications if the content is not sanitized properly, as it allows inserting raw HTML which could potentially execute scripts or cause other security vulnerabilities. Additionally, using innerHTML to modify large portions of the DOM can be less efficient compared to other DOM manipulation methods like using createElement and appendChild.
