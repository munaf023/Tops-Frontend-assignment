    <!-- Array vs object defences in JS? -->

    Arrays:
    Ordered Collection:
    <br>
    <br>
    Arrays are ordered collections of data. Each element in an array is accessed by an index (starting from 0) that
    represents its position in the array.
    Example: let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    <br>

    Homogeneous Data: <br>
    Arrays typically hold homogeneous data types, meaning elements are usually of the same type (e.g., all numbers, all
    strings).

    Iterating: <br>
    Arrays are optimized for iterating over elements using loops like for or array methods like forEach, map, filter,
    etc.
    <br>
    Methods: <br>
    Arrays have built-in methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, etc.) that facilitate manipulation, sorting,
    and transformation of array elements.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Objects: <br>
    Key-Value Pairs: <br>
    Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is a unique string (or symbol), and each value
    can be of any data type.
    Example: let obj = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
    <br>
    Unordered:
    <br>
    Unlike arrays, the order of properties in an object is not guaranteed. Properties can be accessed using their keys
    rather than numeric indices.
    <br>
    Dynamic Properties:
    <br>
    Objects are versatile for storing and accessing data based on dynamic keys or properties. This makes them suitable
    for representing entities with various attributes.
    <br>
    Methods:
    <br>
    Objects can have methods defined as properties, which are functions that perform operations related to the object's
    state or behavior.
