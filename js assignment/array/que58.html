    <!-- What is Bom vs Dom in JS?  -->

    <p>
        In JavaScript, <b>"BOM"</b> stands for <i>Browser Object Model</i>, while <b>"DOM"</b> stands for <i>Document Object Model.</i> These two
        terms refer to different aspects of the web browser environment that JavaScript interacts with:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        1.<u><i>DOM (Document Object Model):</i></u>
        <br>
        The DOM represents the structured representation of an HTML document. It provides a way for programs to
        dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of the document.
        JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change the structure, style, or content of a webpage dynamically.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2.<u><i>BOM (Browser Object Model):</i></u>
        <br>
        The BOM represents the various objects provided by the web browser environment other than the document. It
        includes objects like window, navigator, screen, history, and location.
        The window object is the top-level object in the BOM and represents the browser window that contains the DOM
        document.
